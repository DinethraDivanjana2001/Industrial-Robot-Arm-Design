## Introduction

This project focuses on the design and implementation of an industrial robotic arm capable of performing a variety of tasks in an industrial setting. The goal is to create a versatile and efficient robotic solution for automation.

## Design and Mechanism

The design and mechanism of the industrial robotic arm are critical to its functionality and efficiency. This section will cover the following aspects:

- **3D Design and Modeling**: Utilizing CAD software (such as SolidWorks) to create detailed 3D models of the robotic arm.
- **Structural Design**: Developing a robust and reliable structure that can withstand industrial environments.
- **Kinematic Analysis**: Analyzing the movement and motion capabilities of the robotic arm to ensure precise control.
- **Material Selection**: Choosing appropriate materials to balance durability, weight, and cost.
- **Actuation and Control Mechanisms**: Designing the actuation systems (motors, servos) and control mechanisms to achieve accurate and responsive movements.

## Project Structure
